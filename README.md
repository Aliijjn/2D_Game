# 2D Game
This is my take on a more complex 2D game, featuring different blocks and items, inventory management and even crafting and smelting mechanics. It's all written in C++, using a mix of Windows.h, OpenGL and my own library for window management and rendering sprites.

## What I've learned from this project âœ…
- Managing large data structures
- How to use OpenGL
- How to load and display a custom font

### You spawn in an open world, filled with trees and rocks. With a bit of effort, you can use these to make some advanced tools

### You can start by hitting a tree, but as you can see, that takes quite long...

### Instead, you can gather some branches and pebbles

### After picking up a couple of those, you can press 'E' to show your inventory
### Here, you can also see your crafting recipes

### Click on one of the items to the right of the '>>' to craft them

### With this pickaxe, you can break stones much easier
### You can select the pickaxe if it's in your hotbar, by pressing the corresponding number (1-6) or by using your mouse wheel

### An axe will let you do the same to a tree

### Eventually, you might stumble across some Iron Ore, which takes a bit longer to break

### This will drop raw iron after breaking it, which you'll need to smelt into bars to use for crafting

### You can do this by crafting a fireplace.
### Select the campfire which you can place down by selecting it and then clicking on an open area with the right mouse button

### Then you can start a fire by adding logs to the campfire

### Once the fire has started, you can add the raw iron to smelt it

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bdf0dba-dc02-46fd-86c0-e9ae3fbc36d2)
### Then you can use that iron to craft a better axe, letting you cut down trees even faster
